# FundMe
A blockchain based crowd sourcing application that allows users to send amount to a smart contract and an admin to withdraw from the same.
This application uses a Solidity smart contract that, when deployed, can accept payments from users (min. 1 USD). Later, the admin account can withdraw funds form this smart contract. There is also the added functionality to see the list of funders and check how much amount each user has funded.
